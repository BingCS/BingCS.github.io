I am an Assistant Professor in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at the Faculty of Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). Before joining PolyU, I was recognized as a TopMinds (天才少年) by Huawei, where I led a research team in the Optical Application Product Line and developed advanced solutions for Smart Cockpits and AR-HUDs. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Oxford.

My research focuses on Spatial AI, a dynamic field where I aim to advance human-level spatial perception and world understanding on mobile robotics platforms such as drones, underwater vehicles, and ground robots. My work addresses the critical need for robust and efficient spatial perception solutions that substantially improve the reliability, intelligence, and security of intelligent machines in real-world settings.
