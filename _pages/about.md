I am an Assistant Professor in **Robotics and Autonomous Systems** at the Faculty of Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). I completed my DPhil in Computer Science at the University of Oxford, under the supervision of <a href="https://raeng.org.uk/about-us/fellowship/new-fellows-2022/professor-niki-trigoni-freng" target="_blank">Prof. Niki Trigoni</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/andrew.markham/" target="_blank">Prof. Andrew Markham</a>. Earlier, I was supervised by <a href="https://ysg.ckcest.cn/html/details/8332/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Qingquan Li</a> at Shenzhen University. Before joining PolyU, I was recognized as a TopMinds (天才少年) by Huawei, where I led the Optical Application Product Line, developing advanced solutions for Smart Cockpits and AR-HUDs.

My research focuses on **Spatial Intelligence**, a dynamic field where I aim to advance human-level spatial perception and world understanding on mobile robotics platforms such as drones, underwater vehicles, and ground robots. My work addresses the critical need for robust and efficient spatial perception solutions that substantially improve the **reliability, intelligence, and security** of intelligent machines in real-world settings.
